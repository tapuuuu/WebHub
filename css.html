            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental technology used to define the visual appearance and layout of web pages. Developed alongside HTML and JavaScript, CSS serves as the styling language that controls the presentation of HTML documents on the World Wide Web.
            CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. By separating content from presentation, CSS allows web designers and developers to create visually appealing and consistent web pages across different devices and screen sizes.
            The core principles of CSS include cascading, specificity, and inheritance. The cascading nature of CSS allows multiple style rules to be applied to the same HTML element, with the most specific rule taking precedence. Specificity determines which styles are applied when conflicting rules exist, while inheritance enables styles to be passed down from parent elements to their children.
            CSS offers a wide range of selectors and properties that enable precise control over the appearance of HTML elements. Selectors target specific elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and relationship to other elements, allowing for highly targeted styling.
            CSS preprocessors like Sass and LESS extend the capabilities of CSS by introducing features such as variables, mixins, and nested rules, which enhance code organization and maintainability.
            CSS plays a vital role in web development by allowing designers and developers to create visually engaging and responsive web pages that adapt to various devices and user preferences. Its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful features make it an essential tool for crafting modern web experiences.
